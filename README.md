# Bluedos

Sometimes we meet with people who like to listen music, and so loud that we, and our ears don't really like it.
Fortunately, if the sound is broadcast on a Bluetooth device, this simple *Python* script can help make music *quieter*.

Also you can use it to test your devices for **DOS** attack stability.
